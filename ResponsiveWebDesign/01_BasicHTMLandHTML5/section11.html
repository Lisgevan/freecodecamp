    <h2>11. Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements</h2>
    <p>Change your external link to an internal link by changing the href attribute to "#footer" and the text
        from cat photos to Jump to Bottom.</p>
    <p>Remove the target="_blank" attribute from the anchor tag since this causes the linked document to open in
        a new window tab.</p>
    <p>Then add an id attribute with a value of footer to the
        &lt;footer&gt; element at the bottom of the page.</p>
