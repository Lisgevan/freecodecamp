            <h2>03. Use Headings to Show Hierarchical Relationships of Content</h2>
            <p>Camper Cat wants a page on his site dedicated to becoming a ninja. Help him fix the headings so his
                markup gives semantic meaning to the content, and shows the proper parent-child relationships of his
                sections. Change all the h5 tags to the proper heading level to indicate they are subsections of the h2
                ones. Use h3 tags for the purpose.</p>
