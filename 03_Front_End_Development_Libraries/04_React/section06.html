    <h2> 06 - Learn About Self-Closing JSX Tags </h2>
    <p> Fix the errors in the code editor so that it is valid JSX and successfully transpiles. Make sure you don't
        change any of the content - you only need to close tags where they are needed.

    <h3>Starter Code:</h3>
    <xmp>
        const JSX = (
        <div>
            <h2>Welcome to React!</h2> <br>
            <p>Be sure to close all tags!</p>
            <hr>
        </div>
        );
    </xmp>
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <xmp>
        const JSX = (
        <div className="myDiv">
            <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
        </div>
        );
