    <h2> 11 - Send Action Data to the Store </h2>
    <p>
        There's a basic notesReducer() and an addNoteText() action creator defined in the code editor. Finish the body
        of the addNoteText() function so that it returns an action object. The object should include a type property
        with a value of ADD_NOTE, and also a text property set to the note data that's passed into the action creator.
        When you call the action creator, you'll pass in specific note information that you can access for the object.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, finish writing the switch statement in the notesReducer(). You need to add a case that handles the
        addNoteText() actions. This case should be triggered whenever there is an action of type ADD_NOTE and it should
        return the text property on the incoming action as the new state.
    </p>
    <p>
        The action is dispatched at the bottom of the code. Once you're finished, run the code and watch the console.
        That's all it takes to send action-specific data to the store and use it when you update store state.
    </p>
    <h3>Starter Code:</h3>
    <xmp>
        const ADD_NOTE = 'ADD_NOTE';

        const notesReducer = (state = 'Initial State', action) => {
        switch(action.type) {
        // Change code below this line

        // Change code above this line
        default:
        return state;
        }
        };

        const addNoteText = (note) => {
        // Change code below this line

        // Change code above this line
        };

        const store = Redux.createStore(notesReducer);

        console.log(store.getState());
        store.dispatch(addNoteText('Hello!'));
        console.log(store.getState());
    </xmp>
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <xmp>
        const ADD_NOTE = 'ADD_NOTE';

        const notesReducer = (state = 'Initial State', action) => {
        switch(action.type) {
        // Change code below this line
        case "ADD_NOTE":
        state = action.text
        return state
        // Change code above this line
        default:
        return state;
        }
        };

        const addNoteText = (note) => {
        // Change code below this line
        return {
        type: "ADD_NOTE",
        text: note
        }
        // Change code above this line
        };

        const store = Redux.createStore(notesReducer);

        console.log(store.getState());
        store.dispatch(addNoteText('Hello!'));
        console.log(store.getState());
