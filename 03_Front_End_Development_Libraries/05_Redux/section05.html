    <h2> 05 - Dispatch an Action Event </h2>
    <p>
        The Redux store in the code editor has an initialized state that's an object containing a login property
        currently set to false. There's also an action creator called loginAction() which returns an action of type
        LOGIN. Dispatch the LOGIN action to the Redux store by calling the dispatch method, and pass in the action
        created by loginAction().
    </p>
    <h3>Starter Code:</h3>
    <xmp>
        const store = Redux.createStore(
        (state = {login: false}) => state
        );

        const loginAction = () => {
        return {
        type: 'LOGIN'
        }
        };

        // Dispatch the action here:
    </xmp>
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <xmp>
        const store = Redux.createStore(
        (state = {login: false}) => state
        );

        const loginAction = () => {
        return {
        type: 'LOGIN'
        }
        };

        // Dispatch the action here:
        store.dispatch(loginAction())
    </xmp>
