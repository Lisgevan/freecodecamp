    <h2> 02 - Get State from the Redux Store </h2>
    <p>
        The code from the previous challenge is re-written more concisely in the code editor. Use store.getState() to
        retrieve the state from the store, and assign this to a new variable currentState.
    </p>
    <h3>Starter Code:</h3>
    <xmp>
        const store = Redux.createStore(
        (state = 5) => state
        );

        // Change code below this line
    </xmp>
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <xmp>
        const store = Redux.createStore(
        (state = 5) => state
        );

        // Change code below this line
        const currentState = store.getState()
    </xmp>
