    <h2> 01 - Create a Redux Store </h2>
    <p>
        The Redux store is an object which holds and manages application state. There is a method called createStore()
        on the Redux object, which you use to create the Redux store. This method takes a reducer function as a required
        argument. The reducer function is covered in a later challenge, and is already defined for you in the code
        editor. It simply takes state as an argument and returns state.
    </p>
    <p>
        Declare a store variable and assign it to the createStore() method, passing in the reducer as an argument.
    </p>
    <h3>Starter Code:</h3>
    <xmp>
        const reducer = (state = 5) => {
        return state;
        }

        // Redux methods are available from a Redux object
        // For example: Redux.createStore()
        // Define the store here:
    </xmp>
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <xmp>
        const reducer = (state = 5) => {
        return state;
        }

        // Redux methods are available from a Redux object
        // For example: Redux.createStore()
        // Define the store here:
        const store = Redux.createStore(reducer)
    </xmp>
