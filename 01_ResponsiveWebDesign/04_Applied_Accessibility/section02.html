            <h2>02. Know When Alt Text Should be Left Blank</h2>
            <p>Camper Cat has coded a skeleton page for the blog part of his website. He's planning to add a visual
                break between his two articles with a decorative image of a samurai sword. Add an alt attribute to the
                img tag and set it to an empty string. (Note that the image src doesn't link to an actual file - don't
                worry that there are no swords showing in the display.)</p>
