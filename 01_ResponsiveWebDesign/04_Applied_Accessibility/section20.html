            <h2>20. Make Links Navigable with HTML Access Keys</h2>
            <p>Camper Cat wants the links around the two blog article titles to have keyboard shortcuts so his site's
                users can quickly navigate to the full story. Add an accesskey attribute to both links and set the first
                one to g (for Garfield) and the second one to c (for Chuck Norris).</h3>
