        <h1>Basic CSS</h1>
        <hr>

        <section>
            <h2>28. Override Styles in Subsequent CSS</h2>
            <p>Create an additional CSS class called blue-text that gives an element the color blue. Make sure it's
                below your pink-text class declaration.</p>
            <p>
                Apply the blue-text class to your h1 element in addition to your pink-text class, and let's see which
                one wins.
            </p>
            <p>
                Applying multiple class attributes to a HTML element is done with a space between them like this:
            </p>
            <xmp>
                class="class1 class2"
            </xmp>
            <p>
                Note: It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the order of the class declarations in the &lt;style&gt;
                section is what is important. The second declaration will always take precedence over the first. Because
                .blue-text is declared second,
                it overrides the attributes of .pink-text</p>
            </p>

                        color: green;
                    }

                    .pink-text {
                        color: pink;
                    }
